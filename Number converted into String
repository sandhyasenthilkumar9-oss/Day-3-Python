# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Read input as integer
num = int(input())
# Dictionary mapping integers to their string equivalents
num_to_str = {
    0: "Zero",
    1: "One",
    2: "Two",
    3: "Three",
    4: "Four",
    5: "Five",
    6: "Six",
    7: "Seven",
    8: "Eight",
    9: "Nine"
}
# Check if input is within the valid range
if 0 <= num <= 9:
    print(f"Integer is {num} and String is {num_to_str[num]}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
