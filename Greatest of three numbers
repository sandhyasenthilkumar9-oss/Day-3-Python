 #Read three integers from input
num1, num2, num3 = map(int, input().split())
# Determine the greatest number
if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    print(f"Number1 is maximum with value of {float(num1)}.")
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:
    print(f"Number2 is maximum with value of {float(num2)}.")
else:
    print(f"Number3 is maximum with value of {float(num3)}.")
